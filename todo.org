  - [X] Possibly related: ?date=2018-11-09T19:03:43.482Z - highlights 7th period as current on
    an even day.
* Enhancements
  - [X] provide (hidden) string with date for testing
  - [X] change layout on narrow screens to remove the hyphen between start and end times and
    force the times to be on separate lines (css breakpoints!)
  - [ ] add buttons to override day type (e.g. all day on a wednesday)
  - [ ] cookie or local storage to remember who you're tracking
* Generalizing & Monetizing
** Generalizing
*** For Wilson
    - separate period begin/end data from student data
    - make separate student class names that correlate with periods
    - dynamic table for 1-4 students, more?
    - canonical list of irregular days
    - preserve privacy but also allow ability to share with others
*** Monetizing
    - offer at ~$15/family/year with some portion going to Wilson Drama
*** Prep & Deploy [2/8]
